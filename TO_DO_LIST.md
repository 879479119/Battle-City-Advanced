## What to do next?

### FIX BUGS
+ :white_check_mark: grass will be destroyed when enemy is attacked below it
+ enemies run like walking dead, should they be smarter but not much more ?
+ make collision detection runs before any movement, which leads to many BUGS
+ :white_check_mark: editor mode operating area overflows
+ :white_check_mark: cannon lies in a layer above grass, ani't matching the old version
+ complete the rules of game, ensure it runs same as the old one
+ our tank lose control when press several keys same time
+ :white_check_mark: game mode canvas lies out of the center of grid

### UPDATE

+ **Game Mode**:
    + :white_check_mark: draw construction in a single canvas, or it takes much time to update it every frame
    + user cannot fire while running now
    + :white_check_mark: enemies may stop to fire for a period when meet block
+ **Editor Mode**:
    + :white_check_mark: tool selected animation
    + let user modify the size of map
    + enemy base individuation providing count and type
+ **Profile Mode**:
    + add challenge mode, default maps
    + select maps form server(user share)
+ others:
    + operate tank on phone via scanning a qr-code
    + multiple player and more than one base
    + build a game center where people could pick their partner up to play together
